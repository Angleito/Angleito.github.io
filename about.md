Seeking opportunities to combine my technical learning journey and customer-focused background in a software development role.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Sui Move
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Blockchain & DeFi:** Sui Blockchain, Smart Contract Development, DEX Integration, Flash Loans, Trading Bots, Cross-platform DeFi Solutions
- **AI & ML:** Claude Integration, LangChain, LLM Model Training, Benchmarking & Optimization, MLOps, Prompt Engineering
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Microservices Architecture, Containerization, CI/CD
- **Data & APIs:** API Integration (Bluefin, 7k Protocol), Real-time Data Processing, Technical Analysis
- **System Design:** Resilient Systems, Error Handling, Security Best Practices

## Projects

- **QwenSuiCoder - LLM Benchmarking & Training Framework:** Developed an end-to-end solution for benchmarking, optimizing, and fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 models specialized for Sui blockchain development. Built with hardware-aware model selection that automatically determines optimal model size, quantization level, and context length based on available resources. Features include automated benchmarking across various model sizes (0.5B to 14B parameters), smart parameter selection, and DeepSpeed-optimized training with ZeRO optimization. The system demonstrates proficiency in MLOps, Python, and model optimization techniques while providing a specialized AI assistant for Sui blockchain development. *(Contact for full implementation details)*

- **BluefinAI Agent Trader - AI-Powered Trading Platform:** Developed a sophisticated, containerized cryptocurrency trading system leveraging AI for market analysis and automated decisions on the Bluefin exchange. Integrates Claude AI for TradingView chart analysis via browser automation within a scalable microservices architecture (Python, Docker). Key components include a Trading Agent, Bluefin API service, Webhook receiver, Screenshot service for AI vision, Position Monitor, Anthropic/LangChain integration for analysis, and Browser control. Features advanced AI chart pattern recognition, robust risk management (position sizing, stops), confidence-threshold trading, multi-timeframe analysis, and external signal integration. Demonstrates expertise in AI integration, microservices, financial systems programming, and secure API communication. *(Full implementation available upon request)*

- **Flashloanbot - Automated DeFi Trading on Sui:** Created an automated trading bot for the Sui blockchain designed to identify and execute profitable DeFi opportunities like arbitrage, potentially using flash loans. Built with TypeScript, it utilizes the `@mysten/sui.js` SDK for blockchain interaction and integrates with the 7k Protocol DEX aggregator (`@7kprotocol/sdk-ts`) to find optimal swap rates and build efficient transaction paths across multiple DEXs. Core features include secure private key management, real-time quote generation, transaction building/signing, Sui token address validation, and resilient Sui client connections with fallback mechanisms for API availability. While the core swap execution logic is implemented, the project structure anticipates a higher-level orchestrator for complex arbitrage/flashloan strategies. Demonstrates strong Sui development, DeFi concepts, SDK integration, complex automation, and security awareness. *(Full implementation available upon request)*

- **Personal Portfolio Website:** Professional website showcasing my development skills and blockchain projects using React.js built with AI-assisted development techniques.
