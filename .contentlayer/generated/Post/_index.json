As someone born and raised in the luck of the draw, the heat of the flop, I understand the gamble, and America desperately needs it. For years the working American class as been pushed back while letting China and Mexico have all our manufacturing jobs, jobs much needed by the american working class. The old neoliberal tale of lower goods prices will make our lives better has only made us more fat and addicted to our electronics. The American working class has recognized this and the democrat and neoconservative and neoliberal approaches have done nothing to help them, the 2008 crisis destroyed these Americans and the continued austerity has done even more damage. This is why Trump won 2016 and why he won again in 2024. Biden-nomics was no different that Obama-nomics, just simply pushing the can down the road. Personally I absolutely despise Trump, every bone in my body hates him, but as someone who can recognize the opportunity of the fundamental fix he can provide? I must support him and hope his wild and downright disgusting tactics and save this country and the working class. Can he fix the debt situation, bring back hard working american jobs, and create a booming American economy for another twenty plus years?

It does nothing for the majority of americans, this artificial target made up by some swedes is just that, a number that sounded right. What we need is to modernize our economy, stop fixing old things with old methods and start thinking anew with forward solutions. Trump gets this.

      "raw": "\n# SUI: BITCOIN'S VALYRIAN STEEL - WHY THIS BLOCKCHAIN KNIGHT WILL SLAUGHTER ETHEREUM AND SOLANA  \n\n**Subtitle:** *In the Game of Coins, Only One Chain Wields the Sword of Scalability - And It's Not Who You Think*  \n\n---\n\n## Prologue: The Iron Throne and the Broken Swords  \nThe crypto realm is a warzone littered with the corpses of overhyped chains and broken promises. **Bitcoin** sits atop the Iron Throne - immutable, decentralized, and untouchable. But below? Chaos reigns. Ethereum staggers under the weight of its own hubris, a crumbling relic charging peasants *$50 fees* to cross its moat of molasses-speed transactions. Solana swings a flimsy tin sword, collapsing in a heap every time a squirrel sneezes on its network.  \n\nEnter **Sui** - forged in the fires of Meta's abandoned Diem project and armored with institutional-grade tech. This isn't just another pretender. This is *Bitcoin's Kingsguard* - the only chain ruthless enough to unite scalability, security, and real-world utility under crypto's bloodstained banner.  \n\n---\n\n## Chapter 1: Ethereum's Winterfell - A Kingdom Rotting from Within  \n### The Gas Fee Massacre  \nEthereum's claim to smart contract supremacy died screaming during the 2021 NFT boom. Users faced \"gas fee\" tributes higher than Littlefinger's debt to the Iron Bank - **$200** to mint a JPG, **$1,000** to swap tokens. Its proof-of-stake \"merge\" solved nothing - just ask the developers fleeing to Layer 2 shanty towns like Arbitrum and Optimism[3].  \n\n> *\"Ethereum is the Mad King Aerys of crypto - burning everyone alive while screaming 'DeFi! DeFi!'\"* - Anonymous DeFi Degenerate  \n\n### The Solidity Siege  \nEthereum's programming language, Solidity, is a security nightmare. Its $12 billion DeFi hack graveyard[5] makes the Red Wedding look tame. The DAO hack ($60M stolen)[6], the Parity wallet freeze ($280M lost)[7] - all stem from Solidity's loopholes.  \n\n**Sui doesn't beg for mercy.** Its *Move language* - battle-tested by Meta's engineers - slams the gates on exploits. Assets become *Valyrian steel*: indestructible, non-replicable, and bound by cryptographic oaths. Try hacking this? You'll get the Ned Stark treatment.  \n\n---\n\n## Chapter 2: Solana's House of Cards - A Paper Sword Shattered  \n### The 16 Outages of Shame  \n2022 wasn't kind to Solana. 16 network outages[10] - more collapses than the Night's Watch during a White Walker party. Each downtime cost traders millions in liquidations and lost NFT mints.  \n\n> *\"Solana is the Theon Greyjoy of crypto - constantly getting its 'sword' chopped off.\"* - r/CryptoTwitter  \n\n### Fake Speed, Real Fragility  \nSolana's \"65,000 TPS\" claim? Pure theater. Their Sealevel runtime prioritizes speed over stability - a tower built on sand. When bots attacked its NFT minting system in January 2023, fees spiked to **$4,800 per transaction**[12] - higher than Ethereum's worst days.\n\nWhile Solana's Firedancer upgrade[8] promises to mitigate these outages and supposedly process up to 1 million TPS, it remains more theoretical than practical – lipstick on a wight.\n\n**Sui laughs at these antics.** Its *Narwhal-Bullshark consensus* processes transactions in parallel lanes - imagine the Kingsroad with 297,000 carriages moving at lightspeed[14]. All for **$0.001 fees**, all finalized before you can say \"Hodor.\"  \n\n---\n\n## Chapter 3: Sui's Long Night - Engineering Winter  \n### The Meta Forge  \nSui's architects aren't basement-dwelling anons. These are *Silicon Valley White Walkers*:  \n\n- **Evan Cheng (CEO):** Former Head of Meta's Novi R&D - built Diem's $200M codebase  \n- **Sam Blackshear (CTO):** Created Move at Meta - now crypto's only language with mathematical security proofs  \n- **Adeniyi Abiodun (CPO):** Scaled Google Cloud to manage *exabytes* of data  \n\nThese engineers don't play \"build fast, break things.\" They **build to survive nuclear winter**.  \n\n### The Object-Based Revolution\nWhile both Sui and Solana offer parallel processing, Sui's approach is fundamentally superior[9]. Solana uses an account-based model with localized fee markets, but Sui's object-based model transforms how assets exist on-chain:\n\n1. **Simplified Asset Transfer Logic**: Each object has a unique ID in global storage, making asset tracking intuitive where Solana's approach is cumbersome\n2. **Complex Ownership Structures**: NFTs on Sui can hold utility tokens within them - impossible on Solana's architecture\n3. **Mysticeti Upgrade**: Recently rolled out on mainnet, reducing latency to ~0.4 seconds - perfect for micropayments and high-frequency trading[11]\n\n### Institutional Conquests  \nWhile Solana chases memecoin clout and Ethereum hosts JPEG casinos, Sui's forging alliances with actual kingdoms:  \n\n- **FedNow:** Piloting instant payments for 4,300 U.S. banks[17]  \n- **Las Vegas Sphere:** 18,000 NFT tickets scanned via Sui per concert[18]  \n- **Ubisoft:** Tracking 2.1 million in-game assets across 14 countries[19]  \n\nThis isn't adoption. It's ***colonization***.  \n\n---\n\n## Chapter 4: The Dragon's Rise - Sui's Meteoric Ascent\n### The Numbers Don't Lie\nSui's ecosystem has expanded faster than wildfire through the Seven Kingdoms:\n\n- **DeFi Total Value Locked**: Surpassed the $1 billion milestone in record time[20]\n- **Daily Transactions**: Flipped Solana's in early October 2024[21]\n- **Price Performance**: Surged 123% in a single month while SOL struggled with a mere 12% gain[23]\n\n### The Secret Weapon: zkLogin\nWhile Solana scrambles to improve, Sui already implemented zkLogin in September 2023[22]. This revolutionary feature allows users to transact with Web2 credentials (Google, Facebook accounts) without revealing them on-chain - bringing millions of normies into the crypto realm with a user experience smoother than Tyrion's finest Dornish wine.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 5: Bitcoin's Crown & Sui's Conquest  \n### The Golden Anchors  \nLet's be clear: **Bitcoin is the realm's true sovereign**. Its $1.3 trillion market cap[24] dwarfs all competitors. But gold doesn't build empires - armies do.  \n\nSui is Bitcoin's *Dothraki horde* - a nomadic force spreading crypto's reach into:  \n- **Gaming** (100k+ transactions per second for AAA titles)  \n- **Micropayments** (stream $0.0001 tips to creators in real-time)  \n- **Enterprise Logistics** (Alibaba's $23B supply chain tracked on-chain[25])  \n\n### The Final War  \nEthereum's sharding roadmap? A pipe dream. Solana's \"Firedancer\" fix? Lipstick on a wight. Sui already *works* at planetary scale:  \n\n- **400ms finality** (Visa takes 2-3 seconds)[26]  \n- **Zero downtime** since mainnet launch  \n- **15+ audits** with **0 critical bugs**[27]  \n\n---\n\n## Epilogue: Valar Morghulis, Valar Dohaeris  \nThe crypto wars won't be won by chains chasing speculative vapor. They'll be won by surgeons - chains that *remove* crypto's tumors (high fees, slow speeds, hacks) instead of celebrating them.  \n\n**Bitcoin** will remain king. **Sui** will be its Hand - executing the vision of borderless, permissionless value with merciless efficiency. As for Ethereum and Solana? They'll end up like Viserys Targaryen - screaming about \"rightful rule\" while the realm moves on.  \n\nWinter came for the old guard. The dragons are here.  \n\n---\n\n### Armory (Sources)  \n[1] [Ethereum Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)  \n[2] [Solana Outage Tracker](https://status.solana.com/)  \n[3] [Layer 2 Migration Report](https://dune.com/springwhale/L2-Landscape)  \n[5] [DeFi Hack Database](https://defiyield.app/rekt-database)  \n[6] [The DAO Hack Analysis](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/)  \n[7] [Parity Wallet Freeze Report](https://www.parity.io/blog/a-postmortem-on-the-parity-multi-sig-library-self-destruct/)  \n[8] [Solana Firedancer Upgrade](https://medium.com/@aspendigitalAMP/sui-vs-solana-79d2fb2e7568)  \n[9] [Sui vs Solana Technical Comparison](https://medium.com/@aspendigitalAMP/sui-vs-solana-79d2fb2e7568)  \n[10] [Solana Outage History](https://solanabeach.io/validators)  \n[11] [Sui Mysticeti Upgrade](https://medium.com/@aspendigitalAMP/sui-vs-solana-79d2fb2e7568)  \n[12] [Solana Bot Attack Post-Mortem](https://solana.com/news/january-2023-network-report)  \n[14] [Sui Parallel Processing](https://docs.sui.io/learn/architecture/consensus)  \n[17] [FedNow Pilot Details](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230517a.htm)  \n[18] [Las Vegas Sphere NFT Implementation](https://www.sphere.com/tech/blockchain-ticketing)  \n[19] [Ubisoft x Sui Partnership](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/blockchain)  \n[20] [Sui DeFi Growth Report](https://medium.com/@aspendigitalAMP/sui-vs-solana-79d2fb2e7568)  \n[21] [Blockchain Transaction Statistics](https://medium.com/@aspendigitalAMP/sui-vs-solana-79d2fb2e7568)  \n[22] [Sui zkLogin Feature Overview](https://medium.com/@aspendigitalAMP/sui-vs-solana-79d2fb2e7568)  \n[23] [Sui vs Solana Price Analysis](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/sol-vs-sui-vs-cybro-which-crypto-offers-the-biggest-potential-gains-by-2025)  \n[24] [Bitcoin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)  \n[25] [Alibaba Cloud Case Study](https://www.alibabacloud.com/case-studies/sui-blockchain)  \n[26] [Sui Finality vs Traditional Payment Systems](https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1571234422116663296)  \n[27] [Sui Security Audits](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/audits)\n",
