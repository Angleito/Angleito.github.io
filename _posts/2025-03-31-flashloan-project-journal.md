# Flashloan Project Development Journal

This page contains a chronological timeline of development journal entries for the Flashloan Project, documenting the progress, challenges, and learnings throughout the development process.

## Timeline

### 2025 03 31
  
  ### What I Did Today
  - Fixed many type errors as well as reconfigure database to be more practical and lightweight for the purposes of the flashloan.
  - Implemented a journal system to document the project as I go along, should have been created earlier but there is still much to fix and configure for the full implementation of the project.
  
  ### Why I Made These Changes
  Database structure was unnecessary as we only need simple token and pool ids to fetch, not a structured authenticated database of secret and secure files, made the structure faster and lighterweight on top of being easier to maintain.
  
  ### What I Learned
  - How to fix types better and use ai to leverage large amount of error fixes using documentation and scripts.
  
  ### What's Next
  - To run the project in early production and ensure it can execute real flashloans with this early implementation, then clean project repo to be more structured
  
  ### Any Blockers or Concerns?
  -  Concerned about technical debt and weary of security handling
  
  ### Notes for Future Reference
  - Test, Test, Test
