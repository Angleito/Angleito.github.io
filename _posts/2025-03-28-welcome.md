# Modern Web Development Practices

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, staying current with web development best practices is crucial. This article explores some of the most important trends and techniques that are shaping modern web development.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

CI/CD pipelines have revolutionized how we deliver web applications. By automating the testing and deployment process, development teams can:

- Detect bugs earlier in the development cycle
- Deploy more frequently with confidence
- Maintain consistent quality across releases

A typical CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions might look like:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment commands
```

## Performance Optimization

Web performance directly impacts user engagement and conversion rates. Key strategies include:

1. **Code splitting**: Loading only the JavaScript needed for the current view
2. **Image optimization**: Using next-gen formats like WebP and proper sizing
3. **Lazy loading**: Deferring non-critical resources until needed
4. **Caching strategies**: Implementing effective browser and CDN caching

## Conclusion

Embracing these modern web development practices can significantly improve both the developer experience and end-user satisfaction. For code examples and implementation details, check out my [sample project repository]({{ page.github_repo }}).
