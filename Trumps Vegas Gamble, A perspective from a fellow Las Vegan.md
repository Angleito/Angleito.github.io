**# Trump's Vegas Gamble, A Perspective From A Fellow Las Vegan**

### **The Art of Economic Contradictions**

Let me be blunt: Donald Trump's economic agenda dances on a knife's edge, and I'm here for it. As someone born and raised in the luck of the draw, the heat of the flop, I understand the gamble, and America desperately needs it. For years the working American class as been pushed back while letting China and Mexico have all our manufacturing jobs, jobs much needed by the american working class. The old neoliberal tale of lower goods prices will make our lives better has only made us more fat and addicted to our electronics. The American working class has recognized this and the democrat and neoconservative and neoliberal approaches have done nothing to help them, the 2008 crisis destroyed these Americans and the continued austerity has done even more damage. This is why Trump won 2016 and why he won again in 2024. Biden-nomics was no different that Obama-nomics, just simply pushing the can down the road. Personally I absolutely despise Trump, every bone in my body hates him, but as someone who can recognize the opportunity of the fundamental fix he can provide? I must support him and hope his wild and downright disgusting tactics and save this country and the working class. Can he fix the debt situation, bring back hard working american jobs, and create a booming American economy for another twenty plus years? I think he can and if he fails at least someone had the guts to go all in.

Here's why: The Fed's 2% inflation target is obsolete in a world where U.S. debt grows faster than GDP. It does nothing for the majority of americans, this artificial target made up by some swedes is just that, a number that sounded right. What we need is to modernize our economy, stop fixing old things with old methods and start thinking anew with forward solutions. Trump gets this. His rumored push for **century bonds**—100-year debt to lock in today's rates—isn't just Zoltan Pozsar's brainchild ([Credit Suisse, 2023](https://www.credit-suisse.com)). It's survival arithmetic. *"You can't outrun a debt spiral with quarterly Treasury auctions. You need generational fixes."*

### **The Triffin Trap—and Why the 'Mar-a-Lago Accord' Matters**

The **Triffin dilemma** is no academic footnote—it's why your Bitcoin portfolio matters. For decades, the U.S. supplied global dollar liquidity at the cost of ballooning deficits. We have taken the sacrifice and hurt our own people for the good of the world, and what do we get in return? Nothing. Its time we look out for ourselves and take true ownership of our american libertarian views the founding fathers distilled into us. But who will take this great sacrifice? Who will take on the worlds reserve currency? Bitcoin and stablecoins, thats who. Trump's team sees the endgame: either collapse the system or reboot it with new upgraded software.

This is where Lyn Alden's "**Mar-a-Lago Accord**" theory grabs me and tethers rise to U.S. Treasury dominance makes me ponder. ([Alden, 2024](https://www.lynalden.com), [Tether, 2025](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-becomes-7th-largest-us-treasury-holder-stablecoin-growth)). Imagine a geopolitical deal where Gulf states, Asian allies, and the stablecoin crypto industry absorb U.S. debt in exchange for military, tech favors, and financial stability. It's messy, realpolitik, and borderline desperate, but it's exactly the kind of "creative destruction" Washington needs. My take? *"Global reserve currencies don't die quietly. They either transform or take hostages."*

### **Scott Bessent vs. The Hammer**

Let's address the elephant in the room: Trump's policy civil war. On one side, adviser **Scott Bessent**—a Soros protégé—wants to cool markets with fiscal restraint. Tell snake charmed silver-tongued lies while the mad man bull that trump is, is thrashing around the fine china of the us stock market. On the other, Trump's 2025 tax cut proposals are pure adrenaline for risk assets, but the tariffs cause real stagflation considering inflation hasn't slowed all too much.

I've seen this movie before. In 2018, Trump tweeted markets into submission, then pivoted to stimulus. Today's tension is strategic: Bessent's "feather" aims to smooth transitions, while Trump's "hammer" forces structural change. The result? Short-term pain for long-term sovereignty. As my Russian pen pal once told me: *"Once you survive a bear attack, you can survive anything."*

### **Crypto's Golden Age (Thanks to Debt Madness)**

Let's talk crypto. If century bonds fail—and I give them 50/50 odds—Bitcoin becomes the ultimate hedge. During Trump's first term, BTC surged 180% as deficits exploded ([CoinGecko, 2020](https://www.coingecko.com)). The lesson? *"Fiat chaos breeds crypto demand."*

But here's my contrarian angle: A successful debt overhaul *also* helps crypto. Why? Because sustainable U.S. finances reduce systemic risk, making blockchain innovation (not speculation) the focus. Trump's pro-crypto pivot isn't philanthropy—it's a bet that decentralized tech can thrive in a rebalanced fiscal order. On top of using the U.S's new finanical health to add crypto to its balance sheet, further legitimizing an amazing industry. Trump understands the "Only Up" mentality of crypto.

### **Pain Now, Power Later**

Yes, markets will scream. Century bonds could trigger a 1994-style bond massacre. The dollar might waffle as BRICS nations test alternatives. But consider history: Volcker's rate hikes gutted the 1980s economy but killed inflation for decades.

I'll leave you with this: America's debt addiction won't be cured with half-measures. Trump's team is opting for radical surgery because Band-Aids expired in 2008. As I wrote in my Substack last month: *"Bear markets don't build resilience—surviving them does."*
